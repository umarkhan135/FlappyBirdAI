# FlappyBirdAI

This project is a Python implementation of the popular game Flappy Bird, with an added twist: the players are AI agents trained via NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). The AI learns to play and master the game, beating it by the 4th generation.

### Features
  - A fully functional Flappy Bird clone created with PyGame
  - An AI that learns to play the game using a genetic algorithm to evolve neural networks over generations.
  - Dynamic display of scores and generation count, creating an interactive and competitive AI development environment.
